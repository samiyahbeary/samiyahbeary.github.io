<h2>How THIS Ai Music Mashup Video Was Created!</h2>

  <a href="About.html">How The Ai Music Video Mashup Was Made</a>
</div>
<p>A Life Of Sorts is an Ai music video demonstrating that you can't buy happiness through wealth, but rather through friends/family/& people who bring out the best in you. Some scenes of the video resemble glamorization of luxury, while the other clips are the complete opposite, showing the contemporary moments/events that are more steady. Many of the Ai voices incorporated are cartoon characters that are apart of people's childhood and this highlights growing up. In my opinion, the video starts off as destructive, which are the (cons) and materialistic/consumerism view, whereas as the video progresses, it continues to showcase having that peaceful vibe and calm setting to it, that's identified as the pros. I made these 3 videos into a playlist. The first video's genre was rap&pop, the second video consisted entirely of rock, and the third video was a reverse clip of both the first and second video along with extra music video edits that kind of transcend my project but highlight the powerful use of Ai, by using tools such as Musicfy, Stable Diffusion, Photo Ai generators, such as DeepAi and Picsart free trial for a while till it expired, Runway, and multiple video editor(s) of course to piece it all together. In addition, there's a 4th video clip. In this case, I used a mix of Final Cut Pro and Wondershare, and a bit of iMovie in order to render it to Youtube successfully. This editing wasn't constant, as I had to play around with and edit the videos for any fine tuning and adjustments/enhancements. My style tends to be chaotic due to maybe the song choices, but I think the rock song clips were personally my favorite. I wanted to make sure the duration wasn't too long but neither too short, kind of like a Youtube Rewind Video in terms of the time span. But I created separate mini videos and put it into a playlist so it'd be easier for users to access.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The purpose of my project was to create a video that seems random, but if you listen closely the song lyrics match the music video. That's what my intention was. I also chose to do this project because I have a passion and liking for music/video editing as it's something I've done before as a kid. I had this curiosity. Likewise, I would make AMVs, and all sorts of projects. But at the time, I was a novice and wasn't that great at editing. Moreover, before I found it difficult. However, now I love video editing/music remixing, as it is one of my hobbies. Overtime, it was challenging generating some of the Runway videos, GIFS, & images, due to the end result looking a little funny. But it all worked out in the end. My goal was to accumulate the time frame like that of a Youtube Rewind Video. They're usually extended music videos and are long.</p>
