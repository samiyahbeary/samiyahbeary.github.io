<p>So my Net Art site is basically Avril Lavigne themed.
</p>
The site incorporates everything about her, her songs incorporated into each of the pages, along with hyperlinks and text, as well as mp3 audio and mp4 video playing, and an HTML form included for money, that gets the user input and I included a submit button. Also, I included pictures and subtext and titles, as well as CSS coding that with colors and backgrounds, and formatting of the texts, with fonts. Plus, I implemented gifs, and radio buttons, and tried different stylized options HTML has to offer. In addition, to make it seem collaborative, the user interface is quite simple, and easy to read what is on screen, so I edited the text size as well, and made several adjustments here and there, with the headers, along with stylizing the letters to italics, bold, or to simply just keep the default setting. Moreover, I tried to clone one image as the entire background for one of the pages, as I learned how to do this in a Web Tech Design class I took in the 12th grade.
